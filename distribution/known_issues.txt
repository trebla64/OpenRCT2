Release version: 0.0.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Scenario editor object selection window will show object names in the selected language at the time of building the object cache. (Deleting plugin.dat in Documents/OpenRCT2 will fix this)
* Guest AI is slightly worse than the original game.
* Multiplayer is very experimental and is likely to desynchronise often.

Some bugs or limitations present in the original game have not yet been fixed or lifted.
